abstract = {The present invention provides a method whereby more of the water produced by burning the fuel is condensed. It does this by reducing the volume of inert gas in the inlet gases, such that the proportion of water vapour is higher in the flue (exit) gases. According to the present invention, the inlet air is enriched in oxygen before combustion of the fuel. This increases the proportion of water vapour in the flue gas and, for the same amount of inlet fuel and the same condenser temperature, more of the water vapour produced is condensed thus increasing the efficiency of the boiler. A condensing boiler is understood to be a boiler which burns a fuel with an oxidiser where some of the flue gases resulting from the combustion is condensed, either in a single condenser or in an external heat-recovery condenser. An additional refinement is to increase the pressure in a condenser, with or without electrical energy recovery of the higher pressure at the flue exit, which also increases the proportion of water which is condensed.},

With the exhaustion of fossil resources the energy economy will change from a chemical to an electrical base. This transition is one of physics, not one of politics. It must be based on proven technology and existing engineering experience. The transition process will take many years and should start soon: Unfortunately, politics seems to listen to the advice of visionaries and lobby groups. Many of their qualitative arguments are not based on facts and physics. A secure sustainable energy future cannot be based on hype and activism, but has to be built on solid grounds of established science and engineering. In this paper the energy needs of a hydrogen economy are quantified. Only 20%-25% of the source energy needed to synthesized hydrogen from natural compounds can be recovered for end use by efficient fuel cells. Because of the high energy losses within a hydrogen economy the synthetic energy carrier cannot compete with electricity. As the fundamental laws of physics cannot be chanced by research, politics or investments, a hydrogen economy will never make sense. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The binary interaction parameter (BIP) involved in the Van der Waals mixing rules of CEoSs is introduced with special attention to the temperature-dependent functions used to express it. The following questions are addressed: what is the physical meaning of the BIP? How does this parameter reveal deviations from ideal mixtures? What are the connections between Van der Waals and advanced (EoS/gE) mixing rules? What are the best methods to correlate this parameter? How can we predict it? In conclusion, the limitations and performances of models involving Van der Waals mixing rules, including BIPs, are examined and compared to the CEoSs based on advanced mixing rules.},

Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources through electrolysis and subsequently injecting it into the natural gas network, gives flexibility in power grid regulation and the energy storage. In this context, knowledge about the hydrogen percentage content, which can safely effect on materials in a long time steel pipeline service during transport of the hydrogen-natural gas mixture, is essential for operators of a transmission network. This paper first reviews the allowable content of hydrogen that can be blended with natural gas in existing pipeline systems, and then investigates the impact on linepack energy with both startup and shutdown of the compressors scenarios. In the latter case, an unsteady gas flow model is used. To avoid spurious oscillations in the solution domain, a flux limiter is applied for the numerical approximation. The GERG-2008 equation of state is used to calculate the physical properties. For the case study, a tree-topological high pressure gas network, which have been in-service for many years, is selected. The outcomes are valuable for pipeline operators to assess the security of supply.},

This is because it is less efficient, more costly, and more environmentally harmful than alternatives such as heat pumps and district heating. SUMMARY In the context of achieving net zero climate targets, heating poses a significant decarbonization challenge, with buildings contributing substantially to global energy consumption and carbon emissions. While enhancing energy efficiency in building fabric can reduce emissions, complete elimination is not feasible while relying on fossil-fuel-based heating systems. Hydrogen has been suggested for decarbonizing buildings in recent years as a potential solution for replacing fossil-fuel heating. This paper carries out a meta-review of 54 independent studies to assess the scientific evidence for using hydrogen for heating buildings. The analysis concludes that the scientific evidence does not support a major role for hydrogen in cost-optimal decarbonization pathways being associated with higher energy system and consumer costs. Electrification and district heating are deemed preferable due to higher efficiency and lower costs in the majority of analyzed studies.},

Pipeline transmission appears to be the most economical means of transporting large quantities of hydrogen over great distances. However, before hydrogen can be widely used, a new network of pipelines will have to be constructed to ensure its transport. An alternative to the rather costly investment in the new infrastructure could be a utilization of the existing network of gas pipelines by adding hydrogen to natural gas and transporting the mixture. The new solution should be analysed regarding issues related to compression and the transport process itself, but consideration should also be given to the problem of the consequences of a gas pipeline failure. The paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of the process of compression and pipeline transport of the natural gas/hydrogen mixture with safety issues.},

Several alternative explicit models to the Colebrook equation have been proposed. To date, most of the accurate explicit models have been those with three logarithmic functions, but they require more computational time than the Colebrook equation. In this study, a new explicit non-linear regression model which has only two logarithmic functions is developed. The new model, when compared with the existing extremely accurate models, gives rise to the least average and maximum relative errors of 0.0025% and 0.0664%, respectively. Moreover, it requires far less computational time than the Colebrook equation. It is therefore concluded that the new explicit model provides a good trade-off between accuracy and relative computational efficiency for pipe friction factor estimation in the fully developed turbulent flow regime.},

The study involves designing of an optimal configuration of a pipeline system with optimum pipeline size and optimum number of compressors. The pipeline system used as a case study consists of three pipelines (pipeline A, 1,6km, pipeline B, 2 km, and pipeline C, 2.4 km) to a field manifold and eventually to a central processing facility (CPF) via a bulk line which is 75 km to the CPF. The optimization techniques employed in this study were iterative estimation method and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm method. Upheaval buckling analysis, on-bottom stability analysis and pipeline end expansion analysis were further performed on the flowline system to ensure that it is strong enough to contain and transport the Non-Associated Gas (NAG) the CPF while satisfying the life span requirement and at minimum cost of investment and operation. The results shows that the optimal pipe diameter for the three hookup pipelines and the bulkline considered are 6", 6", 8", and 20" respectively. The upheaval buckling analysis results show that the flowlines are not at risk from upheaval buckling at a burial depth of 1.2m with safety factors greater than1.5 for all imperfection heights. The on-bottom stability analysis results show that the flowlines are stable and the wall thicknesses are sufficient for the attainment of a negative buoyancy effect at the swamp sections and shall not require concrete coating. The optimal number of compressor stations analysis shows that 1 intermediate compressor is needed to effectively move the gas via the bulkline from the field manifold to the CPF. The analysis could be applied to other pipeline systems.},

   abstract = {Domestic energy consumption in the United Kingdom depends on both meteorological and socio-economic factors. The former are dominated by the effect of temperature during the colder months of the year, with the energy demand increasing as the temperature decreases. Warming of the UK climate under the influence of anthropogenic forcings is therefore expected to lead to a reduction in domestic energy consumption. Here, we present an end-to-end attribution study that investigates whether the anthropogenic effect on consumption is already evident in the United Kingdom. We analyse data of gas and electricity use in UK households during 2008–2019 and use a simple linear model to express the temperature dependence. Uncertainties in the resulting transfer functions are derived with a recent methodology, originally introduced for downscaling purposes, but adapted here for use in impact studies. The transfer functions are applied to temperature data from simulations with and without the effect of human influence on the climate, generated by 11 state-of-the-art climate models. We thus assess the anthropogenic impact on energy consumption during the reference period by comparing it with what it might have been in a climate without anthropogenic climate change, but at the same level of adaptation. We find that without human influence on the climate, UK households would consume on average about 1,400 kWh more per year, which would increase the annual energy bills by about 70 GBP. Our attribution assessment provides useful evidence of an impact that has already emerged, which can help inform UK's adaptation plans as the climate continues to warm.},

   abstract = {The operating principle of condensing boilers is based on exploiting heat from flue gases to pre-heat cold water at the inlet of the boiler: by condensing into liquid form, flue gases recover their latent heat of vaporization, leading to 10–12% increased efficiency with respect to traditional boilers. However, monitoring the energy efficiency of condensing boilers is complex due to their nonlinear dynamics: currently, (static) nonlinear efficiency curves of condensing boilers are calculated at quasi-stationary regime and ‘a posteriori’, i.e. from data collected during chamber tests: therefore, with this static approach, it is possible to monitor the energy efficiency only at steady-state regime. In this work we propose a novel model-based monitoring approach for condensing boilers that extends the operating regime for which monitoring is possible: the approach is based on a hybrid dynamic model of the condensing boiler, where state-dependent switching accounts for dynamically changing condensing/non condensing proportions. Monitoring the energy efficiency over the boiler's complete dynamic regime is possible via switching estimators designed for the different condensing/non condensing modes. By using real-world boiler efficiency data we show that the proposed approach results in a (dynamic) nonlinear efficiency curve which gives a more complete description of the condensing boilers operation than static nonlinear efficiency curves: in addition, the dynamic curve can be derived ‘a priori’, i.e. from first principles, or from data collected during normal boiler operation (without requiring special chamber tests).},

In this study, the performance of existing equations collected from studies on vertical pipes is assessed, and an approximation for the λ of vertical pipes in the full flow regime, without Re, is proposed. The performance of the Brkić and Praks equation is the best, with a maximum relative error (MRE) of 0.003% (extremely accurate). The MRE of the new approximation is 0.43%, and its assessment level is very accurate. This work is expected to provide a reference for the design and investigation of the drainage of vertical pipes.},

   abstract = { The use of hydrogen (H 2 ) as a substitute for fossil fuel, which accounts for the majority of the world’s energy, is environmentally the most benign option for the reduction of CO 2 emissions. This will require gigawatt-scale storage systems and as such, H 2 storage in porous rocks in the subsurface will be required. Accurate estimation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of H 2 mixed with other gases found within the storage system is therefore essential for the efficient design for the processes involved in this system chain. In this study, we used the established and regarded GERG-2008 Equation of State (EoS) and SuperTRAPP model to predict the thermo-physical properties of H 2 mixed with CH 4 , N 2 , CO 2 , and a typical natural gas from the North-Sea. The data covers a wide range of mole fraction of H 2 (10–90 Mole%), pressures (0.01–100 MPa), and temperatures (200–500 K) with high accuracy and precision. Moreover, to increase ease of access to the data, a user-friendly software (H2Themobank) is developed and made publicly available. },

When predicting the resulting energy consumption it is frequently assumed that heating demand is unchanged from before the switch from gas heating. However, heating patterns usually change, with a net increase in heating demand to achieve the same level of thermal comfort. This paper discusses the change in pattern and uses modelling to determine the resulting increase in energy demand. It shows that the increase can be predicted with information about dwelling heat loss and thermal mass as well as weather and the pre and post switch heating pattern. The increase can be 20% or more for homes with high heat loss. It proposes that the metric for heating demand increase would be a useful measure of heat pump readiness, and that the parameters required to assess this should be provided on energy performance certificates.},

Forecasts predict that it will also play a vital role in decarbonizing the energy sector. The price of natural gas is determined by its calorific value, which depends on its composition. Thus, the accurate composition quantification of natural gas is essential to both producers and consumers. In this context, proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of pure and mixed hydrocarbon gases have been studied with a desktop spectrometer in the range between 1 to 200 bar. Although spectral linewidth, chemical shift, and relaxation times depend on pressure and composition, the hydrocarbon concentrations of binary, ternary, and an eleven-component gas mixture could be quantified by spectral analysis using Spectral Hard Modeling, a mechanistical multivariate regression. Concentrations determined for the main components at 200 bar by NMR deviated by 0.1 to 0.18 mol% from Gas Chromatography values, leading to a difference in calorific values of only 0.15%. The presented results demonstrate that benchtop NMR combined with chemometrics can quantify complex hydrocarbon-gas mixtures reliably and quickly.},

   abstract = {There are proposals to inject hydrogen (H2) from renewable sources in the natural gas network. This measure would allow the very large transport and storage capacities of the existing infrastructure, particularly high-pressure pipelines, to be used for indirect electricity transport and storage. 1. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that an admixture of up to 10 % by volume of hydrogen to natural gas is possible in some parts of the natural gas system. However there are still some important areas where issues remain: 
               -underground porous rock storage: hydrogen is a good substrate for sulphate-reducing and sulphur-reducing bacteria. As a result, there are risks associated with: bacterial growth in underground gas storage facilities leading to the formation of H2S; the consumption of H2, and the plugging of reservoir rock. A limit value for the maximum acceptable hydrogen concentration in natural gas cannot be defined at the moment. (H2-related aspects concerning wells have not been part of this project); 
               -steel tanks in natural gas vehicles: specification UN ECE R 110 stipulates a limit value for hydrogen of 2 vol%; 
               -gas turbines: most of the currently installed gas turbines were specified for a H2 fraction in natural gas of 1 vol% or even lower. 5 % may be attainable with minor modification or tuning measures. Some new or upgraded types will be able to cope with concentrations up to 15 vol%; 
               -gas engines: it is recommended to restrict the hydrogen concentration to 2 vol%. Higher concentrations up to 10 vol% may be possible for dedicated gas engines with sophisticated control systems if the methane number of the natural gas/hydrogen mixture is well above the specified minimum value;
               -many process gas chromatographs will not be capable of analysing hydrogen. Investigations have been conducted to evaluate the impact of hydrogen as related to the above topics. At present it is not possible to specify a limiting hydrogen value which would generally be valid for all parts of the European gas infrastructure and, as a consequence, we strongly recommend a case by case analysis. Some practical recommendations are given at the end of the paper.},

This difference is consistent with a new determination of the mole fraction of argon xAr carried out in 2002 by the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and with recently published results from the LNE. The CIPM equation is based on the molar mass of dry air, which is dependent on the contents of the atmospheric gases, including the concentration of argon. We accept the new argon value as definitive and amend the CIPM-81/91 formula accordingly. The KRISS results also provide a test of certain assumptions concerning the mole fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air. An updated value of the molar gas constant R is available and has been incorporated in the CIPM-2007 equation. In making these changes, we have also calculated the uncertainty of the CIPM-2007 equation itself in conformance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, which was not the case for previous versions of this equation. The 96th CIPM meeting has accepted these changes.}

abstract = {The presence of non-condensable gas significantly deteriorates the heat transfer of water vapor condensation, and the condensation process of a CO2-water vapor mixture is a key process for CO2 separation and purification. In this study, we fabricated an experimental system to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of the mixed vapor condensation using a CO2 mass fraction of 32–85 % at a flow rate of 0.4–1.2 m/s and surface subcooling of 3–70 K. Liquid film thickness, gas-phase diffusion layer thickness, and interface temperature were calculated based on the double boundary layer model. An increase in the flow rate (0.4–1.2 m/s) improved the mixed vapor heat transfer, especially at high CO2 concentrations, and increased the heat transfer coefficient by 177 % at a surface subcooling of 40 K. The lower the surface subcooling, the greater the effect of the flow rate. As the CO2 concentration increased, the liquid film thickness decreased, whereas the gas-phase diffusion layer thickness increased to 1.7 mm, which is tens and hundreds of times the liquid film thickness. Increasing the flow rate slightly changed the liquid film but significantly reduced the gas-phase diffusion layer thickness and afforded a better heat transfer performance. A new heat transfer correlation equation was fitted, and the error of the predicted value was within ± 30 %. This study provides fundamental insights for the design of related heat exchangers.},

Of the 520 data compiled, 158 data were discarded. Possible reasons for the observed discrepancies between datasets are discussed. The 362 measurements that satisfy the acceptance criteria have been correlated by a thermodynamic model based on Henry’s law and on recent high-accuracy equations of state. The assumption that the activity coefficients of aqueous CO2 are equal to unity is found to be valid up to solubilities of approximately 2mol%. At higher solubilities the activity coefficients show a systematic trend from values greater than unity at low temperatures, to values progressively lower than unity at high temperatures. An empirical correction function that describes this trend is applied to the basic model. The resulting corrected model reproduces the accepted experimental solubilities with a precision of better than 2% (1 standard deviation) over the entire P–T–x range considered, whereas the data themselves scatter with a standard deviation of approximately 1.7%. The model is available as a computer code at <www.geo.unibe.ch/diamond>. In addition to calculating solubility, the code calculates the full set of partial molar properties of the CO2-bearing aqueous phase, including activity coefficients, partial molar volumes and chemical potentials.}

abstract = {This paper is written in response to the paper “How green is blue hydrogen?” by R. W. Howarth and M. Z. Jacobson. It aims at highlighting and discussing the method and assumptions of that paper, and thereby providing a more balanced perspective on blue hydrogen, which is in line with current best available practices and future plant specifications aiming at low CO2 emissions. More specifically, in this paper, we show that: (i) the simplified method that Howarth and Jacobson used to compute the energy balance of blue hydrogen plants leads to significant overestimation of CO2 emissions and natural gas (NG) consumption and (ii) the assumed methane leakage rate is at the high end of the estimated emissions from current NG production in the United States and cannot be considered representative of all-NG and blue hydrogen value chains globally. By starting from the detailed and rigorously calculated mass and energy balances of two blue hydrogen plants in the literature, we show the impact that methane leakage rate has on the equivalent CO2 emissions of blue hydrogen. On the basis of our analysis, we show that it is possible for blue hydrogen to have significantly lower equivalent CO2 emissions than the direct use of NG, provided that hydrogen production processes and CO2 capture technologies are implemented that ensure a high CO2 capture rate, preferably above 90%, and a low-emission NG supply chain.},

abstract = {Surface roughness can significantly influence the fluid dynamics and heat transfer in convective flows by inducing perturbations in the velocity profile which affect surface drag, turbulent mixing and heat transfer. While surface roughness can often negatively affect the performance of systems, it can also lead to performance improvements, such as in convective flows where roughness elements have been shown to enhance heat transfer. Turbulent flows over rough surfaces have been studied for about a century leading to significant developments in this field. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has made significant contributions to the knowledge of turbulent flows over rough surfaces as well as evaluation of the developed theories. Moreover, the turbulent closures model has seen wide use for simulation of rough-wall turbulent flows in practical applications where DNS is hindered by its complexity and computational resources. Despite a significant number of experimental and CFD studies and the latest advances in this field, a recent review was not available. Therefore, this review surveys the past and recent experimental and numerical studies to address the fundamentals and theories related to the structure of turbulent flows over rough walls. This study chiefly investigates the structure of mean flow profile over rough surfaces, and its correlation with smooth wall mean flow profile. This review study can contribute to prospective experimental and CFD work, and for characterising rough-wall turbulent flows and heat transfer in different academic and engineering applications such as aerodynamics, hydraulics, meteorology, and manufacturing. The review concludes that despite significant progress, the structure of turbulent flow is still not fully understood. This is mainly due to a lack of systematic studies on the structure of turbulent flow and also due to the variety of roughness which influence the dynamics of the flow in the roughness sublayers. The current roughness scale (sand-grain roughness height) fails to completely characterise roughness in many cases. Therefore, there is a need for a universal roughness scale that can describe every type of roughness and be used in any rough-flow regimes, including fully rough and transitionally rough regimes.},

@article{Allen2007,
abstract = {Recent experiments at Princeton University have revealed aspects of smooth pipe flow behaviour that suggest a more complex scaling than previously noted. In particular, the pressure gradient results yield a new friction factor relationship for smooth pipes, and the velocity profiles indicate the presence of a power-law region near the wall and, for Reynolds numbers greater than about 400 × 103 (R+ > 9 × 103), a logarithmic region further out. New experiments on a rough pipe with a honed surface finish with krms/D= 19.4 × 10-6, over a Reynolds number range of 57 × 103-21 × 106, show that in the transitionally rough regime this surface follows an inflectional friction factor relationship rather than the monotonic relationship given in the Moody diagram. Outer-layer scaling of the mean velocity data and streamwise turbulence intensities for the rough pipe show excellent collapse and provide strong support for Townsend's outer-layer similarity hypothesis for rough-walled flows. The streamwise rough-wall spectra also agree well with the corresponding smooth-wall data. The pipe exhibited smooth behaviour for k s+ ≤ 3.5, which supports the suggestion that the original smooth pipe was indeed hydraulically smooth for ReD≤24 × 106. The relationship between the velocity shift, $\Delta$U//u$\tau$, and the roughness Reynolds number, k s+, has been used to generalize the form of the transition from smooth to fully rough flow for an arbitrary relative roughness k rms/D. These predictions apply for honed pipes when the separation of pipe diameter to roughness height is large, and they differ significantly from the traditional Moody curves. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Despite persistent efforts over the last century, a theory for predicting the effects of surface roughness on the mean flow is still missing. Here, we extend a recently proposed multi-state theory to incorporate roughness effects. A formula for the roughness function is constructed by applying the Lie-group invariance theory, giving excellent agreement with the fully collapsed data of both the Nikuradze sand-coated and Princeton honed pipes. A major advantage of the theory is its ability to successfully describe the non-universality-either inflectional or monotonic variations-in a transitionally rough regime with a single sharpness parameter. This model then yields an analytic prediction for the friction factor and mean velocity profiles in rough pipes, agreeing with the empirical data. Consistent with classical understanding (e.g. Townsend's similarity hypothesis), our results confirm the multi-layer theory of wall turbulence, regardless of smooth or rough surfaces. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {In transitional rough pipes, the present work deals with alternate four new scales, the inner wall transitional roughness variable $\zeta$=Z +/$\phi$, associated with a particular roughness level, defined by roughness scale $\phi$ connected with roughness function $\Delta$U+, the roughness friction Reynolds number R$\phi$, (based on roughness friction velocity), and roughness Reynolds number Re$\phi$ (based on roughness average velocity) where the mean turbulent flow, little above the roughness sublayer, does not depend on pipes transitional roughness. In these alternate variables, a two layer mean momentum theory is analyzed by the method of matched asymptotic expansions for large Reynolds numbers. The matching of the velocity profile and friction factor by Izakson-Millikan-Kolmogorov hypothesis gives universal log laws that are explicitly independent of pipe roughness. The data of the velocity profile and friction factor on transitional rough pipes provide strong support to universal log laws, having the same constants as for smooth walls. There is no universality of scalings in traditional variables and different expressions are needed for various types of roughness, as suggested, for example, with inflectional-type roughness, monotonic Colebrook-Moody roughness, etc. In traditional variables, the roughness scale, velocity profile, and friction factor prediction for inflectional pipes roughness are sup ported very well by experimental data.

At intermediate velocities, there is a transition wherein plugs of laminar flow alternate along the pipe with "flashes" of a type of fluctuating, nonlaminar flow that remains poorly understood. In the 19th century, Osborne Reynolds sought to connect these states of flow with quantitative "laws of resistance," whereby the fluid friction is determined as a function of the Reynolds number. While he succeeded for laminar and turbulent flows, the laws for transitional flows eluded him and remain unknown to this day. By properly distinguishing between laminar plugs and flashes in the transitional regime, we show experimentally and numerically that the law of resistance for laminar plugs corresponds to the laminar law and the law of resistance for flashes is identical to that of turbulence.},

abstract = {Nikuradse's [1] work on friction factors focused on the turbulent flow regime in addition to being performed in large diameter pipes. Laminar data was collected by Nikuradse, however only low relative roughness values were examined. A recent review by Kandlikar [2] showed that the uncertainties in the laminar region of Nikuradse's experiments were very high, and his conclusion regarding no roughness effects in the laminar region is open to question. In order to conclusively resolve this discrepancy, we have experimentally determined the effects of relative roughness ranging from 0-5.18% in micro and minichannels on friction factor and critical Reynolds numbers. Reynolds numbers were varied from 30 to 7000 and hydraulic diameters ranged from 198$\mu$m to 1084$\mu$m. There is indeed a roughness effect seen in the laminar region, contrary to what is reported by Nikuradse. The resulting friction factors are well predicted using a set of constricted flow parameters. In addition to higher friction factors, transition to turbulence was observed at decreasing Reynolds numbers as relative roughness increased. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 by ASME.},

abstract = {Gas boilers dominate domestic heating in the UK, and significant efficiency improvements have been associated with condensing boilers. However, the potential remains for further efficiency improvement by refining the control, system specification and installation in real dwellings. Dynamic building simulation modelling, including detailed heating system componentry, enables a deeper analysis of boiler underperformance. This paper explores the link between the space heat oversizing of boilers and on/off cycling using dynamic simulation, and their subsequent effect on boiler efficiency and internal temperatures. At plant size ratio (PSR) 8.5 daily cycles numbered over 50, similar to median levels seen in real homes. Simulations show that typical oversizing (PSR >3) significantly increases cycling behaviour and brings an efficiency penalty of 6–9%. There is a clear link between raising PSR, increased cycling and an associated decreased efficiency; however, in the UK, boilers are regularly oversized with respect to space heating, especially combination boilers to cover peak hot water demand. Current legislation and labelling (ErP and SAP) overlook PSR as a determinant of system efficiency, failing to incentivise appropriate sizing. Reducing boiler oversizing through addressing installation practices and certification has the potential to significantly improve efficiency at low cost, decreasing associated carbon emissions. Practical application: This research provides the basis for a practical and cost effective means of assessing the potential for underperformance of boiler heating systems at the point of installation or refurbishment. By assessing the oversizing of the boiler with respect to space heating, unnecessary cycling and the associated efficiency penalty can be avoided. Plant size ratio, as an indicator of cycling potential, can be implemented in energy performance certificates (EPCs), through the standard assessment procedure (SAP), using existing data. The potential for real carbon savings in the existing boiler stock is considerable, and the findings have wider implications for next generation heating systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we derive an accurate composite friction factor versus Reynolds number correlation formula for laminar, transition and turbulent flow in smooth and rough pipes. The correlation is given as a rational fraction of rational fractions of power laws which is systematically generated by smoothly connecting linear splines in log-log coordinates with a logistic dose function algorithm. We convert Nikuradse's (1933) (J. Nikuradse, 1933 Stromungsgesetz in rauhren rohren, vDI Forschungshefte 361. (English translation: Laws of flow in rough pipes). Technical report, NACA Technical Memorandum 1292. National Advisory Commission for Aeronautics (1950), Washington, DC.) data for six values of roughness into a single correlation formula relating the friction factor to the Reynolds number for all values of roughness. Correlation formulas differ from curve fitting in that they predict as well as describe. Our correlation formula describes the experimental data of Nikuradse's (1932, 1933) (J. Nikuradse, Laws of turbulent flow in smooth pipes (English translation), NASA (1932) TT F-10: 359 (1966).) and McKeon et al. (2004) (B.J. McKeon, C.J. Swanson, M.V. Zaragola, R.J. Donnelly, and J.A. Smits, Friction factors for smooth pipe flow, J. Fluid Mech. 511 (2004), 41-44.) but it also predicts the values of friction factor versus Reynolds number for the continuum of sand-grain roughness between and beyond those given in experiments. Of particular interest is the connection of Nikuradse's (1933) data for flow in artificial rough pipes to the data for flow in smooth pipes presented by Nikuradse (1932) and McKeon et al. (2004) and for flow in effectively smooth pipes. This kind of correlation seeks the most accurate representation of the data independent of any input from theories arising from the researchers ideas about the underlying fluid mechanics. As such, these correlations provide an objective metric against which observations and other theoretical correlations may be applied. Our main hypothesis is that the data for flow in rough pipes terminates on the data for smooth and effectively smooth pipes at a definite Reynolds number R$\sigma$($\sigma$); if $\lambda$ = f(Re, $\sigma$) is the friction factor in a pipe of roughness parameter $\sigma$ then $\lambda$ = f(R$\sigma$($\sigma$), $\sigma$) is the friction factor at the connection point. An analytic formula giving R$\sigma$ ($\sigma$) is obtained here for the first time.},

abstract = {To achieve the Net-Zero Emissions goal by 2050, a major upscale in green hydrogen needs to be achieved; this will also facilitate use of renewable electricity as a source of decarbonised fuel in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and transport. Nearly 80% of the world's offshore wind resource is in waters deeper than 60 m, where bottom-fixed wind turbines are not feasible. This creates a significant opportunity to couple the high capacity factor floating offshore wind and green hydrogen. In this paper we consider dedicated large-scale floating offshore wind farms for hydrogen production with three coupling typologies; (i) centralised onshore electrolysis, (ii) decentralised offshore electrolysis, and (iii) centralised offshore electrolysis. The typology design is based on variables including for: electrolyser technology; floating wind platform; and energy transmission vector (electrical power or offshore hydrogen pipelines). Offshore hydrogen pipelines are assessed as economical for large and distant farms. The decentralised offshore typology, employing a semi-submersible platform could accommodate a proton exchange membrane electrolyser on deck; this would negate the need for an additional separate structure or hydrogen export compression and enhance dynamic operational ability. It is flexible; if one electrolyser (or turbine) fails, hydrogen production can easily continue on the other turbines. It also facilities flexibility in further expansion as it is very much a modular system. Alternatively, less complexity is associated with the centralised offshore typology, which may employ the electrolysis facility on a separate offshore platform and be associated with a farm of spar-buoy platforms in significant water depth locations.},

@article{Abbas2021,
abstract = {As an alternative to the construction of new infrastructure, repurposing existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transportation has been identified as a low-cost strategy for substituting natural gas with hydrogen in the wake of the energy transition. In line with that, a 342 km, 36″ natural gas pipeline was used in this study to simulate some technical implications of delivering the same amount of energy with different blends of natural gas and hydrogen, and with 100% hydrogen. Preliminary findings from the study confirmed that a three-fold increase in volumetric flow rate would be required of hydrogen to deliver an equivalent amount of energy as natural gas. The effects of flowing hydrogen at this rate in an existing natural gas pipeline on two flow parameters (the compressibility factor and the velocity gradient) which are crucial to the safety of the pipeline were investigated. The compressibility factor behaviour revealed the presence of a wide range of values as the proportions of hydrogen and natural gas in the blends changed, signifying disparate flow behaviours and consequent varying flow challenges. The velocity profiles showed that hydrogen can be transported in natural gas pipelines via blending with natural gas by up to 40% of hydrogen in the blend without exceeding the erosional velocity limits of the pipeline. However, when the proportion of hydrogen reached 60%, the erosional velocity limit was reached at 290 km, so that beyond this distance, the pipeline would be subject to internal erosion. The use of compressor stations was shown to be effective in remedying this challenge. This study provides more insights into the volumetric and safety considerations of adopting existing natural gas pipelines for the transportation of hydrogen and blends of hydrogen and natural gas.},

abstract = {A detailed study of SNG transport using a computational model that accounts for compressibility and Joule-Thomson effects is presented, for the first time. It shows that the transport distance and mass flow rate of supercritical natural gas (SNG) - above the cricondenbar and cricondentherm, and beyond the anomalous state - can exceed far beyond that achieved or proposed under high pressure, dense phase conditions, thus far. As an example, SNG (average composition of USA/Canada gas), at 800 kg/s can travel, without recompression, to 4801 km. It is revealed that the pressure-drop and pumping power per unit length decrease asymptotically as the inlet pressure increases beyond 20 MPa; orders-of-magnitude lower than that at low pressures. The increase in inlet pressure, pipe diameter, and/or heat conductance of the pipe wall increases the distance travelled by SNG whereas the increase in mass flow rate and surrounding temperature has a negative effect, including the strengthening of Joule-Thomson cooling near the exit. SNG pipelines at ocean bottom offer many advantages, including shorter distances, isothermal flows (∼4 °C), and balance between the outer and inner pressures. Also, SNG delivery at 6 MPa can allow regional distribution without immediate recompression. SNG pipelines therefore offer enormous possibilities of energy-efficient transport of natural gas to far-distant intra- and inter-continental destinations, not feasible thus far, which is urgently needed for uninterrupted supply of natural gas and worldwide energy security.},

@article{Alghlam2022,
abstract = {A mathematical model and computational algorithm are derived for the prediction of natural gas pipeline flow. Non-isothermal and compressible steady-state flow is considered. Heat transfer between gas flow and surroundings is taken into account together with the heat generation due to the gas friction on the inner pipeline wall. The computational algorithm is based on the marching procedure with defined initial conditions. The predicted thermal effect of the wall friction is validated by the simulation of a case that is available in the open literature. The influence of heat generation by gas wall friction in the long transmission pipeline on gas pressure and temperature is evaluated. Differences between results obtained with and without the heat generation due to gas wall friction are analysed. The heat generation due to gas friction on the pipeline inner wall has an influence on the gas temperature change along the pipeline, while its influence on the pressure drop is negligible. These detailed results are novel since most of the previously published results on non-isothermal gas flow did not take into account the thermal effect of the gas wall friction or the influence of this effect was not evaluated. The presented results are a support to the gas pipeline design methods and operational analyses.},
